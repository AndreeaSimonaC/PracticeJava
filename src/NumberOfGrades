Find the number of D, C, B and A grades for the last test on informatics,
where n students from a class have successfully passed the test.

The program gets number n as the first line of input
and then gets the grades themselves, each on a new line.

The program must output four numbers in a single line:
the number of D, C, B, and A grades (in that order),
separated by blank space characters.
